	// CALLS MADE AT SERVER STARTUP
	//
	// These calls are made at least once, during server initialization, but
	// are not called when the server is handling requests.

	// Start is called at the beginning of a server's lifecycle, after
	// configuration processing and after the database connection is opened
	// but before web traffic is being served.
	//
	// If an error is returned, then the startup process fails.
	Start() error
	// Stop is called at the end of a server's lifecycle, after the web
	// servers have stopped serving traffic but before the database is
	// closed.
	//
	// If an error is returned, shutdown continues but an error is reported.
	Stop() error

	// Returns a pointer to the configuration struct used by the specific
	// application. It will be used to save and load from configuration
	// files. This object will be passed to SetConfiguration after it is
	// loaded from file.
	//
	// It is expected the Application will return an object with sane
	// defaults. The object's struct definition may have struct tags
	// supported by gopkg.in/ini.v1 for additional customization. For
	// example, the "comment" struct tag is much appreciated by admins.
	// Also, it is very important that keys to not collide, so prefix your
	// configuration options with a common prefix:
	//
	//     type MyAppConfig struct {
	//         SomeKey string `ini:"my_app_some_key" comment:"Description of this key"`
	//     }
	//
	// This configuration object is intended to be stable for the lifetime
	// of a running application. When the command to "serve" is given, this
	// function is only called once during application initialization.
	//
	// The command to "configure" will append these defaults to the guided
	// flow. Admins will then be able to inspect the file and modify the
	// configuration if desired.
	//
	// However, sane defaults for an application are incredibly important,
	// as the "new" command guides an admin through the creation process
	// all the way to serving without interruption. So have sane defaults!
